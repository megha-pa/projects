There are mainly 4 types of Machine Learning
1.Supervised-we have labeled data or input data from which we model learns
I.Regression-when target is numerical data
II.classification-when target is categorical

2.Unsupervised-we dont have output or labeled data
I.clustering-create group of similar
II.Dimenatinality reduction-reduce the column(PCA)
III.Anamoly detection- any kind of defect ex removing outlier from syatem such as credict card fraud
IV.Association Rule-its like if we buy milk even bread is brought so help in systematic aarangement

3.Semisupervised-Ex labeling task

4.Reinforcement Learning-learns from reward self driving car

BATCH VS OFFLINE PREDICTION
Batch prediction-we train on entire data and we deploy it on production enviorement and once new data is added we retrain it and run on prodcution enviorement

Disadvantages of batch prediction
1.lot of data 
2.hardware limitation
3.availablity becasue system is updated only after specified time

online Machine Learning
when data is changing very dynamic and we want faster result
